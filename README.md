### Steps to Run and Test
1. **Environment Setup**: Set up MongoDB locally or use an online service (like MongoDB Atlas). Update `.env` with credentials.

2. **Run Server**: Use `npm start` to run the Express server, or `npm run dev` to run it using Nodemon for auto-restart during development.

3. **API Testing**: Use Postman to verify each endpoint and its response.
   - Create users, employers, job posts, connect them, and run assessments to ensure all functionalities are implemented.
